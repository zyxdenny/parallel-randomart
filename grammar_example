# The first line defines all the rule symbols used in the grammar
#
# The second line is the entry rule for RGB, respectively
#
# The following lines are grammar rules
# Each line has the following patter:
# <rule> -> <prob1> <func1> [subrule1_1] [subrule1_2] ... | <prob2> <func2> [subrule2_1] ... | ...
#
# Supported functions (function name, arity):
#   GET_X       0
#   GET_Y       0
#   RAND        0
#   ID          1
#   SIN         1
#   TAN         1
#   NEG         1
#   SQRT        1
#   ADD         2
#   MULT        2
#   MIX         3
#
# Note: The rules must be constructed such that if the FIRST subrule is always chosen,
# a terminal will be finally reached (otherwise there will be dead locks)
